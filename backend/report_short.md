# Evidence Report: NAD+ Precursors (NMN / NR)

## 1) Intervention Identity
- Type: unknown
- Pivot: None identified
- Query: NAD+ Precursors (NMN / NR)
- Population: unspecified
- Outcome: unspecified
- Ambiguity notes:
  - None identified.
- Directness warnings:
  - None identified.

## 2) Evidence Pyramid
- Level 1 (systematic/meta): 0
- Level 2 (human interventional): 0
- Level 3 (human observational): 0
- Level 4 (animal in vivo): 0
- Level 5 (in vitro): 0
- Level 6 (in silico): 0

## 3) Key Human Evidence
- None identified.

## 4) Trial Registry Audit
- None identified.

## 5) Preclinical Longevity Evidence
- None identified.

## 6) Mechanistic Plausibility
- MP score: 8.0 / 30
- Hallmark tag count (observed in classified records): 0
- Interpretation: plausibility can support prioritization but cannot override weak human evidence.

## 7) Safety Summary
- None identified.

## 8) Confidence Score + Trace
- Overall score: 8.0 (E, very_low)
- CES: 0.0
- MP: 8.0
- Final confidence (trace): 8.0
- Penalties:
  - None identified.
- Bonuses:
  - None identified.
- Caps applied:
  - {'cap': 45.0, 'reason': 'no_human_evidence'}
- Notes:
  - No human evidence detected; score is capped for translational uncertainty.
  - No hard clinical endpoints detected.
  - No human evidence detected; score is capped for translational uncertainty.
  - No hard clinical endpoints detected.

## 9) Evidence Gaps + What Would Change the Score
- Missing evidence levels:
  - No systematic review or meta-analysis evidence (Level 1).
  - No randomized trial evidence (Level 2).
  - No human evidence (Levels 1-3).
- Missing endpoint classes:
  - No hard clinical endpoints identified.
- Next best studies:
  - Run a preregistered randomized trial in older adults with functional outcomes (frailty, hospitalization, mobility).
  - Add hard endpoint follow-up (e.g., morbidity, hospitalization, or validated functional decline endpoints).
- Registry/publication mismatch cautions:
  - None identified.

## 10) Limitations of this Automated Review
- Classification is metadata-driven and may miss details only available in full text.
- Registry/publication linkage can be incomplete for recently completed trials.
- The report reflects retrieved records only; hidden or unpublished studies may change conclusions.
- Records summarized: 0
